/**
 * Compose a custom blend mode for renderers.
 *
 * The functions SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode and SDL_SetTextureBlendMode accept
 * the SDL_BlendMode returned by this function if the renderer supports it.
 *
 * A blend mode controls how the pixels from a drawing operation (source) get
 * combined with the pixels from the render target (destination). First, the
 * components of the source and destination pixels get multiplied with their
 * blend factors. Then, the blend operation takes the two products and
 * calculates the result that will get stored in the render target.
 *
 * Expressed in pseudocode, it would look like this:
 *
 * ```c
 * dstRGB = colorOperation(srcRGB * srcColorFactor, dstRGB * dstColorFactor);
 * dstA = alphaOperation(srcA * srcAlphaFactor, dstA * dstAlphaFactor);
 * ```
 *
 * Where the functions `colorOperation(src, dst)` and `alphaOperation(src,
 * dst)` can return one of the following:
 *
 * - `src + dst`
 * - `src - dst`
 * - `dst - src`
 * - `min(src, dst)`
 * - `max(src, dst)`
 *
 * The red, green, and blue components are always multiplied with the first,
 * second, and third components of the SDL_BlendFactor, respectively. The
 * fourth component is not used.
 *
 * The alpha component is always multiplied with the fourth component of the
 * SDL_BlendFactor. The other components are not used in the alpha
 * calculation.
 *
 * Support for these blend modes varies for each renderer. To check if a
 * specific SDL_BlendMode is supported, create a renderer and pass it to
 * either SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode or SDL_SetTextureBlendMode. They will
 * return with an error if the blend mode is not supported.
 *
 * This list describes the support of custom blend modes for each renderer.
 * All renderers support the four blend modes listed in the SDL_BlendMode
 * enumeration.
 *
 * - **direct3d**: Supports all operations with all factors. However, some
 *   factors produce unexpected results with `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MINIMUM` and
 *   `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MAXIMUM`.
 * - **direct3d11**: Same as Direct3D 9.
 * - **opengl**: Supports the `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD` operation with all
 *   factors. OpenGL versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 do not work correctly here.
 * - **opengles2**: Supports the `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD`,
 *   `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_SUBTRACT`, `SDL_BLENDOPERATION_REV_SUBTRACT`
 *   operations with all factors.
 * - **psp**: No custom blend mode support.
 * - **software**: No custom blend mode support.
 *
 * Some renderers do not provide an alpha component for the default render
 * target. The `SDL_BLENDFACTOR_DST_ALPHA` and
 * `SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA` factors do not have an effect in this
 * case.
 *
 * @param srcColorFactor the SDL_BlendFactor applied to the red, green, and
 *                       blue components of the source pixels.
 * @param dstColorFactor the SDL_BlendFactor applied to the red, green, and
 *                       blue components of the destination pixels.
 * @param colorOperation the SDL_BlendOperation used to combine the red,
 *                       green, and blue components of the source and
 *                       destination pixels.
 * @param srcAlphaFactor the SDL_BlendFactor applied to the alpha component of
 *                       the source pixels.
 * @param dstAlphaFactor the SDL_BlendFactor applied to the alpha component of
 *                       the destination pixels.
 * @param alphaOperation the SDL_BlendOperation used to combine the alpha
 *                       component of the source and destination pixels.
 * @returns an SDL_BlendMode that represents the chosen factors and
 *          operations.
 *
 * @threadsafety It is safe to call this function from any thread.
 *
 * @since This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
