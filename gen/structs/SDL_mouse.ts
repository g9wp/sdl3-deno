/**
 * # CategoryMouse
 *
 * Any GUI application has to deal with the mouse, and SDL provides functions
 * to manage mouse input and the displayed cursor.
 *
 * Most interactions with the mouse will come through the event subsystem.
 * Moving a mouse generates an SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_MOTION event, pushing a button
 * generates SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_BUTTON_DOWN, etc, but one can also query the
 * current state of the mouse at any time with SDL_GetMouseState().
 *
 * For certain games, it's useful to disassociate the mouse cursor from mouse
 * input. An FPS, for example, would not want the player's motion to stop as
 * the mouse hits the edge of the window. For these scenarios, use
 * SDL_SetWindowRelativeMouseMode(), which hides the cursor, grabs mouse input
 * to the window, and reads mouse input no matter how far it moves.
 *
 * Games that want the system to track the mouse but want to draw their own
 * cursor can use SDL_HideCursor() and SDL_ShowCursor(). It might be more
 * efficient to let the system manage the cursor, if possible, using
 * SDL_SetCursor() with a custom image made through SDL_CreateColorCursor(),
 * or perhaps just a specific system cursor from SDL_CreateSystemCursor().
 *
 * SDL can, on many platforms, differentiate between multiple connected mice,
 * allowing for interesting input scenarios and multiplayer games. They can be
 * enumerated with SDL_GetMice(), and SDL will send SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_ADDED and
 * SDL_EVENT_MOUSE_REMOVED events as they are connected and unplugged.
 *
 * Since many apps only care about basic mouse input, SDL offers a virtual
 * mouse device for touch and pen input, which often can make a desktop
 * application work on a touchscreen phone without any code changes. Apps that
 * care about touch/pen separately from mouse input should filter out events
 * with a `which` field of SDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID/SDL_PEN_MOUSEID.
