/**
 * # CategoryFilesystem
 *
 * SDL offers an API for examining and manipulating the system's filesystem.
 * This covers most things one would need to do with directories, except for
 * actual file I/O (which is covered by [CategoryIOStream](CategoryIOStream)
 * and [CategoryAsyncIO](CategoryAsyncIO) instead).
 *
 * There are functions to answer necessary path questions:
 *
 * - Where is my app's data? SDL_GetBasePath().
 * - Where can I safely write files? SDL_GetPrefPath().
 * - Where are paths like Downloads, Desktop, Music? SDL_GetUserFolder().
 * - What is this thing at this location? SDL_GetPathInfo().
 * - What items live in this folder? SDL_EnumerateDirectory().
 * - What items live in this folder by wildcard? SDL_GlobDirectory().
 * - What is my current working directory? SDL_GetCurrentDirectory().
 *
 * SDL also offers functions to manipulate the directory tree: renaming,
 * removing, copying files.
 *
